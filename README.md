# Digital_Image_Processing

## Set 1
1. Write a program to do the following:

    a. Read an image  
    b. Get image info  
    c. Find compression ratio for the copied image  
    d. Display negative of an image  

2. Write a program for histogram plotting of an image

3. Write a program to perform histogram equalization

4. Write a program for performing local histogram equalization

5. Develop a program for the following image enhancement operations:

    a. Brightness enhancement  
    b. Contrast enhancement  
    c. Complement of an image  
    d. Bi-level or binary contrast enhancement  
    e. Brightness slicing  
    f. Low-pass filtering  
    g. High-pass filtering  

6. Develop programs for the following geometrical transformations on an image:

    a. Translation  
    b. Rotation  
    c. Scaling  
    d. Skewing  

## Set 2
1. Write a program to perform 4 arithmetic operations between 2 images.  

2. Take a noisy image. Write a program which reduces the noise by averaging the input image by 2, 8, 16, 32, 128. Compare all the resultant images and find which one is noise-free.  

3. Write a program which implements all the types of linear spatial filters using functions.  

4. Implement a program for image convolution and correlation using a rectangular convolution mask of any odd size. The mask should be input as an ASCII text file. Test your program using the following convolutional kernels:  

   a. 3×3 averaging  
   b. 7×7 averaging  
   c. 11×11 averaging  

5. Write a prgoram for implementing median filtering of an img. Add salt and pepper noise to it. Apply the median filter to the noisy img and compare the results.
   
6. Detect the edges in an ing using the following methods and compare the relative performance of these methods:
   
    a. sobel  
    b. prewitt  
    c. roberts  
    d. lapacian of a gaussian (LoG)   
    e. canny
